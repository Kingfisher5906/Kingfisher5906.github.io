# SJP SchedGen Client - Kingfisher5906.github.io
A student-led project that makes use of Blackbaud API Endpoints to make viewing grade analysis easier.

##The Plan
The goal of the SchedGen Client is to provide an easy way to access class and grade info from Blackbaud, as well as analyze the data and present it in a user-friendly way.

The client is programmed in HTML and uses JavaScript to access Blackbaud Sky API Endpoints and translate the recieved data into an easy to understand way.  The client also uses CSS to chsnge and manipulate how the web client looks.
