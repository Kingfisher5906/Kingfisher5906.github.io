# SJP SchedGen Client - Kingfisher5906.github.io
A student-led project that makes use of Blackbaud API Endpoints to make viewing grade analysis easier.

## The Plan
The goal of the SchedGen Client is to provide an easy way to access class and grade information from Blackbaud, as well as analyze the data and present it in a user-friendly way.

The client is programmed in HTML and uses JavaScript to access Blackbaud Sky API Endpoints and translate the recieved data into ansimpler form.  The client also uses CSS to change and manipulate how the web client looks.
